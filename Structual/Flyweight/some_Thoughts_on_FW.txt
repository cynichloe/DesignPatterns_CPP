my thoughts on flyweight pattern
the problem background is, 
1) a lot of very similar objects need to be created.
--within each group of objects, some intrinsic variables can be derived.
2) objects once created and being used once, 
3) objects once created and used, will not be used again and hence no changes will be made to them--immutable
